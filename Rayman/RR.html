      <h2>JAMIE FLOYD: UPPER WEST SIDE CLASSIC 6</h2>
      <br/>
      <p>
        "Ray Romano rocks. Listen to this: He did a complete GUT on an
        eight-room wreck in less than 8 weeks. I do not recommend it for anyone.
        It is CRAZY. But we have little kids and we had no choice. Ray Romano
        and his team got it done! The place is beautiful!"

      <h2>DONNA AND SCOTT: RESCUED RENOVATION</h2>
      <br/>
      <p>
        "Ray rescued us from a contractor job gone bad. He and his crew are
        great, neat and real artisans. We recommend him very highly and I bet
        before we know it, there will be another "Everybody loves Raymond," but
        on HGTV or TLC!"

      <br/>
      <h2>DAVID SIEGEL: DOUBLED THE VALUE</h2>
      <br/>
      <p>
        "Ray added value in ways that other G.C.s can't. Working with him is a
        pleasure. He more than doubled the value of my apartment through his gut
        renovations. I would recommend him to any person looking to make home
        improvements."
